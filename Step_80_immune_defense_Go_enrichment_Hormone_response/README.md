**🧬 Immune Defense & Hormone Response — GO Enrichment**

This folder contains two R scripts that perform targeted Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Process enrichment on your single-nucleus RNA-seq results from Arabidopsis thaliana roots. One script focuses on immune/defense processes; the other focuses on hormone signaling (SA, JA, ET).

⚙️ 1) GO_Enrichment_ImmuneDefense.R

Purpose

Identify GO:BP terms related to immune and defense responses (e.g., response to oomycete, immune system process, defense response) among:

cluster-specific markers, and/or

DEGs (Infected vs Non-infected).

🌿 2) GO_Enrichment_HormoneResponse.R

Purpose

Identify GO:BP terms related to hormone signaling central to plant immunity:

SA (salicylic acid), JA (jasmonic acid), ET (ethylene)
