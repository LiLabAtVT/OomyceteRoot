**🧫 Cell Marker and Differential Expression (DEG) Analysis Script**

This folder contains the R script used to identify cluster-specific marker genes and generate differential expression (DEG) lists from the integrated single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset.

⚙️ 1️⃣ Script — CellMarkers_DEG_Analysis.R

Purpose

This script identifies genes that define each cluster or cell type and compares transcriptional differences between infected and non-infected nuclei.
The resulting DEG lists are used for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and pathway analysis in downstream steps.
