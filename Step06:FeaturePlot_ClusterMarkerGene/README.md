**FeaturePlot: Marker Gene Expression by Cluster**

This folder contains the R script used to visualize marker gene expression across clusters using FeaturePlot from the Seurat package.
These plots highlight spatial patterns of gene expression on the UMAP embedding, allowing interpretation of tissue-specific or infection-responsive marker distribution in *Arabidopsis thaliana* roots.

⚙️ 1️⃣ Script — FeaturePlot_CellMarkers.R

Purpose

Display cluster-resolved expression patterns for key marker genes identified in earlier analyses.
