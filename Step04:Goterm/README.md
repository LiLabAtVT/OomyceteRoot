**üß† GO Term Enrichment and Annotation Script**

This folder contains the R script used for Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment and biological process annotation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and cluster-specific marker genes identified in the single-nucleus RNA-seq analysis.

‚öôÔ∏è 1Ô∏è‚É£ Script ‚Äî GO_Enrichment_Annotation.R

Purpose

This script identifies overrepresented biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components among genes that are differentially expressed between infected and non-infected Arabidopsis thaliana root nuclei.
It also performs cluster-specific GO enrichment, linking gene signatures to functional responses such as defense, hormone signaling, and stress adaptation.
