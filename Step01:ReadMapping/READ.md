ðŸ§© **Step 1: Download Pathogen Genome**

Obtain *the Phytophthora capsici* genome from NCBI Datasets.

Download both of the following files:

FASTA file â€” contains the genomic sequence.

GTF file â€” contains gene annotations.

Example genome used in this project:

GCA_016618375.1 â€“ Phytophthora capsici genome


Save both files in the designated reference directory before building the combined or species-specific reference.

ðŸŒ¿ ***Step 2: Download Host Genome***

Download the host plant genome from Ensembl Plants.

Obtain both of the following files:

FASTA file â€” genomic DNA sequence.

GTF file â€” gene annotation file.

Example genome used in this project:

Arabidopsis thaliana â€“ Ensembl Plants Release 59

Store both files in your reference directory to prepare for single- or multi-species reference building.
