##ðŸ§¬ Single-nucleus transcriptome analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana roots infected with Phytophthora capsici##
Introduction

Understanding how plant roots coordinate immune responses at the cellular level is fundamental for dissecting hostâ€“pathogen interactions. In this study, we employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to profile the Arabidopsis thaliana root transcriptome following infection with the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora capsici.

By capturing transcriptional changes at 24 hours post-infection (24 hpi), we generated a high-resolution cellular atlas that reveals the spatial and functional dynamics of plant immune responses. Using Seurat-based integration, we analyzed over 26,000 nuclei and identified 13 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters representing major root tissues and cell types.

Comparative analyses between infected and mock samples highlighted the activation of key defense and hormone signaling pathways, including salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene (ET) responses, alongside oxidative stress mechanisms. Conversely, mock-treated roots were enriched for metabolic and translational processes.

Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and marker gene expression profiling further revealed that immune responses to P. capsici are cell-type specific and involve distinct sets of defense-related genes. Together, this study provides a comprehensive reference for host transcriptional reprogramming during early stages of oomycete infection and establishes a framework for exploring plantâ€“pathogen interactions at single-cell resolution.
