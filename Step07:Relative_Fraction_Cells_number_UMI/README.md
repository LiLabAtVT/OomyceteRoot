**üìä Relative Fraction, Cell Number, and UMI Distribution**

This folder contains two R scripts designed to summarize the composition and sequencing depth of the single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset.
They help quantify the relative abundance of nuclei per cluster and visualize the distribution of UMI counts (transcriptional activity) across clusters and samples in Arabidopsis thaliana roots.

‚öôÔ∏è 1Ô∏è‚É£ Script ‚Äî RelativeFraction_CellNumber.R
Purpose

Calculate and visualize the relative proportion of nuclei (cells) in each cluster.
This analysis helps detect shifts in cluster composition between infected (Pos) and non-infected (Neg) samples.

üß¨ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Script ‚Äî UMI_Distribution.R

Purpose

Analyze the distribution of UMI (Unique Molecular Identifier) counts across clusters to assess sequencing depth and transcriptional activity.
