**🎨 Heatmap and DotPlot Visualization Scripts**

This folder contains the R scripts used to visualize cluster-specific marker gene expression and functional gene signatures using heatmaps and dot plots.
These visualizations summarize expression patterns across identified clusters in *Arabidopsis thaliana* roots infected with *Phytophthora capsici*.

⚙️ 1️⃣ Script — Heatmap_Markers.R

Purpose

Generate publication-quality heatmaps showing the expression of top marker genes across clusters or cell types.
This helps illustrate transcriptional identity and highlight infection-responsive clusters.

🧬 2️⃣ Script — DotPlot_FunctionalGenes.R

Purpose

Visualize the average expression and percentage of cells expressing key functional or defense-related genes (e.g., hormone signaling, stress response, immune regulators
