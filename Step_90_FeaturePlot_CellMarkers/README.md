**🎯 FeaturePlot for Selected Marker Genes**

This folder contains an R script to visualize selected marker genes on the UMAP embedding of the integrated snRNA-seq dataset using Seurat’s FeaturePlot.
These figures help validate cluster annotations and highlight infection-responsive genes in Arabidopsis thaliana roots.

⚙️ Script — FeaturePlot_SelectedMarkers.R

Purpose

Plot the spatial expression patterns of a curated set of marker genes (e.g., tissue markers, immune/hormone genes) across clusters on the UMAP.
